        <p>From acting as the sole engineer, a part in a small team, or a team lead, 
          I&apos;ve spent nearly a decade building web apps.</p>

        <p>My passion has evolved from grinding out code to building amazing and robust systems, which means I&apos;ve worked on 
          implementing the TDD/BDD/CI holy trinity.  That means an being lean and being agile.  That means smart people working hard and working smart, 
          but that also means making sure those same people have a chance to grow and experience a balanced life.  And that 
          means smart teams that kick ass.  Teams that help each other grow both professionally and as people.</p>

        <p>After spending the last few months traveling and balancing my life, I am ready to start building again.</p>

        <p>I am currently looking for opportunities in Austin, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Berlin, and Seoul.  Barring an opportunity in a great city, 
        I am also be open to working remotely so I can continue to explore the world at my own pace.  But whatever city I end up working from, 
        there is one thing I will not compromise on&mdash;working with great people.</p>
